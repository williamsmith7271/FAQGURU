## Translations

Translations to other languages are highly encouraged. 
Each official translation will be held as a separate dir in the [FAQGURU](https://github.com/FAQGURU/FAQGURU).


### Creating a New Translation Repo

In order to create a new translation, you need to follow these steps:

* Fork the [main repo](https://github.com/FAQGURU/FAQGURU).
* Add yourself to the watch list of the main repo, to keep up with changes.
* When translating topics, **create NEW files with suffix of your language**.
  * For example, Spanish tranlation for `sql.md` will be on `sql-es.md`.
* Open a [new issue](https://github.com/FAQGURU/FAQGURU/issues/new) and ask to be part of the organization.
* Transfer the repo to the organization.
* Merge new content from the main repo.
* keep translating...
* Rinse/repeat last two steps until a topics is done.

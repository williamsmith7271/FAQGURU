### What is the use of refs? (Junior)

The **ref** is used to return a reference to the element. They should be avoided in most cases, however, they can be useful when we need direct access to DOM element or an instance of a component.

### What is JEST? (Junior)

**Jest** is a JavaScript unit testing framework made by Facebook based on Jasmine and provides automated mock creation and a jsdom environment. It's often used for testing React components.

### What are the advantages of ReactJS? (Junior)

Below are the advantages of ReactJS:
1. Increases the application’s performance with Virtual DOM
2. JSX makes code is easy to read and write
3. It renders both on client and server side
4. Easy to integrate with other frameworks (Angular, BackboneJS) since it is only a view library
5. Easy to write UI Test cases and integration with tools such as JEST.

### How to write comments in ReactJS? (Junior)

The comments in ReactJS/JSX is similar to javascript multiline comments which are wrapped with curly braces:

**Single-line comments:**
```js
<div>
  {/* Single-line comments */}
  Welcome {user}, Let's play React
</div>
```

**Multi-line comments:**
```js
<div>
  {/* Multi-line comments for more than
   one line */}
  Welcome {user}, Let's play React
</div>
```

### What is context? (Junior)

**Context** provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. For example, authenticated user, locale preference, UI theme need to be accessed in the application by many components.

```js
const {Provider, Consumer} = React.createContext(defaultValue);
```

### What is virtual DOM? (Junior)

**The virtual DOM (VDOM)** is an in-memory representation of Real DOM. The representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM. It’s a step that happens between the render function being called and the displaying of elements on the screen. This entire process is called reconciliation.

### How does React work? (Junior)

React creates a virtual DOM. When state changes in a component it firstly runs a "diffing" algorithm, which identifies what has changed in the virtual DOM. The second step is reconciliation, where it updates the DOM with the results of diff.

### What is React? (Junior)

React is an open-source JavaScript library created by Facebook for building complex, interactive UIs in web and mobile applications. React’s core purpose is to build UI components; it is often referred to as just the “V” (View) in an “MVC” architecture.

### What is props in ReactJS? (Junior)

**Props** are inputs to a React component. They are single values or objects containing a set of values that are passed to React Components on creation using a naming convention similar to HTML-tag attributes. i.e, *They are data passed down from a parent component to a child component.*

The primary purpose of props in React is to provide following component functionality:

1. Pass custom data to your React component.
2. Trigger `state` changes.
3. Use via `this.props.reactProp` inside component's `render()` method.

For example, let us create an element with reactProp property,
```js
 <Element reactProp = "1" />
```

This `reactProp` (or whatever you came up with) name then becomes a property attached to React's native props object which originally already exists on all components created using React library.

```js
 props.reactProp;
```

### What are the major features of ReactJS? (Junior)

The major features of ReactJS are as follows,

- It uses **VirtualDOM** instead RealDOM considering that RealDOM manipulations are expensive.
- Supports **server-side rendering**
- Follows **Unidirectional** data flow or data binding
- Uses **reusable/composable** UI components to develop the view

### What is ReactJS? (Junior)

ReactJS is an **open-source frontend JavaScript library** which is used for building user interfaces especifically for single page applications. It is used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps. React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer working for Facebook. ReactJS was first deployed on Facebook’s newsfeed in 2011 and on Instagram.com in 2012.

### What are the limitations of ReactJS? (Mid)

Below are the list of limitations:

1. React is just a view library, not a full-blown framework
2. There is a learning curve for beginners who are new to web development.
3. Integrating React.js into a traditional MVC framework requires some additional configuration
4. The code complexity increases with inline templating and JSX.
5. Too many smaller components leading to over-engineering or boilerplate

### What’s the difference between an "Element" and a "Component" in React? (Mid)

Simply put, a React element describes what you want to see on the screen. Not so simply put, a React element is an object representation of some UI.

A React component is a function or a class which optionally accepts input and returns a React element (typically via JSX which gets transpiled to a createElement invocation).

### What are stateful components? (Mid)

If the behaviour of a component is dependent on the state of the component then it can be termed as _stateful component_. These Stateful components are always class components and have a state that gets initialized in the constructor.

```js
class App extends Component {
 constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  this.state = { count: 0 };
 }

 render() {
    // omitted for brevity
  }
}
```

### What are stateless components? (Mid)

If the behaviour is independent of its state then it can be a _stateless component_. You can use either a function or a class for creating stateless components. But unless you need to use a lifecycle hook in your components, you should go for stateless functional components. There are a lot of benefits if you decide to use stateless functional components here; they are easy to write, understand, and test, and you can avoid the this keyword altogether.

### What are portals in ReactJS? (Mid)

Portal is a recommended way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.

```js
ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container);
```

The first argument (child) is any renderable React child, such as an element, string, or fragment. The second argument (container) is a DOM element.

### What are fragments? (Mid)

It's common pattern in React which is used for a component to return multiple elements. Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

```js
render() {
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <ChildA />
      <ChildB />
      <ChildC />
    </React.Fragment>
  );
}
```

There is also a shorter syntax which is not supported in many tools

```js
render() {
    return (
      <>
         <ChildA />
         <ChildB />
         <ChildC />
      </>
    );
  }
```

### Why is it necessary to capitalize the components? (Mid)

It is necessary because components are not the DOM element but they are constructors. If they are not capitalized, they can cause various issues and can confuse developers with several elements.

###### Source

### What is reconciliation? (Mid)

When a component’s props or state change, React decides whether an actual DOM update is necessary by comparing the newly returned element with the previously rendered one. When they are not equal, React will update the DOM. This process is called **reconciliation**.

### What is the purpose of using super constructor with props argument? (Mid)

A child class constructor cannot make use of **this** reference until `super()` method has been called. The same applies for ES6 sub-classes as well. The main reason of passing props parameter to super() call is to access this.props in your child constructors.

**Passing props:**
```js
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        console.log(this.props);  // Prints { name: 'sudheer',age: 30 }
    }
}
```
**Not passing props:**
```js
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super();
        console.log(this.props); // Prints undefined
        // But Props parameter is still available
        console.log(props); // Prints { name: 'sudheer',age: 30 }
    }

    render() {
        // No difference outside constructor
        console.log(this.props) // Prints { name: 'sudheer',age: 30 }
    }
}
```

The above code snippets reveals that this.props behavior is different only with in the constructor. It would be same outside the constructor.

### What are the advantages of using React? (Mid)

- It is easy to know how a component is rendered, you just need to look at the render function.
- JSX makes it easy to read the code of your components. It is also really easy to see the layout, or how components are plugged/combined with each other.
- You can render React on the server-side. This enables improves SEO and performance.
- It is easy to test.
- You can use React with any framework (Backbone.js, Angular.js) as it is only a view layer.

### What are Higher-Order components? (Mid)

A higher-order component **(HOC)** is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. Basically, it’s a pattern that is derived from React’s compositional nature
We call them as **“pure’ components”**  because they can accept any dynamically provided child component but they won’t modify or copy any behavior from their input components.
```js
const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);
```
HOC can be used for many use cases as below,

1. Code reuse, logic and bootstrap abstraction
2. Render High jacking
3. State abstraction and manipulation
4. Props manipulation

### What are controlled components? (Mid)

A ReactJS component that controls the input elements within the forms on subsequent user input is called **“Controlled component”**. i.e, every state mutation will have an associated handler function.

For example, to write all the names in uppercase letters, we use handleChange as below,

```js
handleChange(event) {
    this.setState({
        value: event.target.value.toUpperCase()
    });
}
```

### What is the difference between a Presentational component and a Container component? (Mid)

* **Presentational components** are concerned with _how things look_. They generally receive data and callbacks exclusively via props. These components rarely have their own state, but when they do it generally concerns UI state, as opposed to data state.

* **Container components** are more concerned with _how things work_. These components provide the data and behavior to presentational or other container components. They call Flux actions and provide these as callbacks to the presentational components. They are also often stateful as they serve as data sources.

### How to create refs? (Mid)

**Refs** are created using `React.createRef()` method and attached to React elements via the ref attribute. In order to use refs throughout the component, just assign the ref to the instance property with in constructor.
```js
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.myRef = React.createRef();
  }
  render() {
    return <div ref={this.myRef} />;
  }
}
```
And:
```js
class UserForm extends Component {
  handleSubmit = () => {
    console.log("Input Value is: ", this.input.value)
  }
  render () {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <input
          type='text'
          ref={(input) => this.input = input} /> // Access DOM input in handle submit
        <button type='submit'>Submit</button>
      </form>
    )
  }
}
```
We can also use it in functional components with the help of closures.

### What are the differences between a class component and functional component? (Mid)

- **Class components** allows you to use additional features such as local state and lifecycle hooks. Also, to enable your component to have direct access to your store and thus holds state.

- When your component just receives props and renders them to the page, this is a **stateless component**, for which a pure function can be used. These are also called dumb components or presentational components.

<h1>Hello!</h1>
   {messages.length > 0 &&
<h2>
    You have {messages.length} unread messages.

### What is the difference between state and props? (Mid)

The *state* is a data structure that starts with a default value when a Component mounts. It may be mutated across time, mostly as a result of user events.

*Props* (short for properties) are a Component's configuration. They are received from above and immutable as far as the Component receiving them is concerned. A Component cannot change its props, but it is responsible for putting together the props of its child Components. Props do not have to just be data - callback functions may be passed in as props.

### How is React different from AngularJS (1.x)? (Mid)

For example, AngularJS (1.x) approaches building an application by extending HTML markup and injecting various constructs (e.g. Directives, Controllers, Services) at runtime. As a result, AngularJS is very opinionated about the greater architecture of your application — these abstractions are certainly useful in some cases, but they come at the cost of flexibility.

By contrast, React focuses exclusively on the creation of components, and has few (if any) opinions about an application’s architecture. This allows a developer an incredible amount of flexibility in choosing the architecture they deem “best” — though it also places the responsibility of choosing (or building) those parts on the developer.

### What is the purpose of callback function as an argument of setState? (Mid)

The callback function is invoked when `setState` finished and the component gets rendered. Since `setState` is **asynchronous** the callback function is used for any post action.

**Note:** It is recommended to use lifecycle method rather this callback function.
```js
setState({name: 'sudheer'}, () => console.log('The name has updated and component re-rendered'));
```

### What is the difference between component and container in react Redux? (Mid)

**Component** is part of the React API. A Component is a class or function that describes part of a React UI.
**Container** is an informal term for a React component that is connected to a redux store. Containers receive Redux state updates and dispatch actions, and they usually don't render DOM elements; they delegate rendering to presentational child components.

### What is the difference between state and props? (Mid)

Both **props** and **state** are plain JavaScript objects. While both of them hold information that influences the output of render, they are different in their functionality with respect to component. i.e, 
* Props get passed to the component similar to function parameters 
* state is managed within the component similar to variables declared within a function.

### What is state in ReactJS? (Mid)

**State** of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component. We should always try to make our state as simple as possible and minimize the number of stateful components.

 Let's create user component with message state,

 ```js
 class User extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
       super(props);

       this.state = {
          message: "Welcome to React world",
       }
    }
    render() {
       return (
          <div>
             <h1>{this.state.message}</h1>
          </div>
       );
    }
 }
 ```

### How to create components in ReactJS? (Mid)

There are two possible ways to create ReactJS Components.

1. **Functional components:** This is the simplest way to create ReactJS components. It accepts props as an Object and returns ReactJS elements. We call it as “functional” because those are pure JavaScript functions.
```js
	function Greeting(props) {
   	   return <h1> Hello, {props.message}</h1> 
	}
```

2. **Class components:** You can also use Es6 class to define component. The above functional component can be written as below,
```js
      class Greeting extends React.Component {
  	    render() {
    		    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.message}</h1>;
  	        }
	    }
```

### What is the difference between Element and Component? (Mid)

An **element** is a plain object describing what you want to appear on the screen in terms of the DOM nodes or other components. Elements can contain other elements in their props. Creating a React element is cheap. Once an element is created, it is never mutated.
The object representation of React element would be as follows,
```js
const element = React.createElement(
  'div',
  {id: 'login-btn'},
  'Login'
)
```
The above createElement returns as object as below,
```js
{
  type: 'div',
  props: {
    children: 'Login',
    id: 'login-btn'
  }
}
```
And finally it renders to the DOM using ReactDOM.render as below,
```js
<div id='login-btn'>Login</div>
```
Whereas a **component** can be declared in several different ways. It can be a class with a render() method. Alternatively, in simple cases, it can be defined as a function. In either case, it takes props as an input, and returns an element tree as the output. JSX transpiled as createElement at the end.
```js
function Button ({ onLogin }) {
  return React.createElement(
    'div',
    {id: 'login-btn', onClick: onLogin},
    'Login'
  )
}
```

### What are refs used for in React? (Mid)

*Refs* are an escape hatch which allow you to get direct access to a DOM element or an instance of a component. In order to use them you add a ref attribute to your component whose value is a callback function which will receive the underlying DOM element or the mounted instance of the component as its first argument.

```js
class UnControlledForm extends Component {
  handleSubmit = () => {
    console.log("Input Value: ", this.input.value)
  }
  render () {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <input
          type='text'
          ref={(input) => this.input = input} />
        <button type='submit'>Submit</button>
      </form>
    )
  }
}
```
Above notice that our input field has a ref attribute whose value is a function. That function receives the actual DOM element of input which we then put on the instance in order to have access to it inside of the handleSubmit function.

It’s often misconstrued that you need to use a class component in order to use refs, but refs can also be used with functional components by leveraging closures in JavaScript.

```js
function CustomForm ({handleSubmit}) {
  let inputElement
  return (
    <form onSubmit={() => handleSubmit(inputElement.value)}>
      <input
        type='text'
        ref={(input) => inputElement = input} />
      <button type='submit'>Submit</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

### When rendering a list what is a key and what is it's purpose? (Mid)

*Keys* help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity. The best way to pick a key is to use a string that uniquely identifies a list item among its siblings. 

```js
render () {
  return (
    <ul>
      {this.state.todoItems.map(({task, uid}) => {
        return <li key={uid}>{task}</li>
      })}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

Most often you would use IDs from your data as keys. When you don't have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item index as a key as a last resort. It is not recommend to use indexes for keys if the items can reorder, as that would be slow.

```js
   render(){
    	return(
         <div>
            <h1> Welcome to React world!!</h1>
         </div>

### Where in a React component should you make an AJAX request? (Mid)

`componentDidMount` is where an AJAX request should be made in a React component. 

This method will be executed when the component “mounts” (is added to the DOM) for the first time. This method is only executed once during the component’s life. Importantly, you can’t guarantee the AJAX request will have resolved before the component mounts. If it doesn't, that would mean that you’d be trying to setState on an unmounted component, which would not work. Making your AJAX request in `componentDidMount` will guarantee that there’s a component to update.

### Describe how events are handled in React. (Mid)

In order to solve cross browser compatibility issues, your event handlers in React will be passed instances of SyntheticEvent, which is React’s cross-browser wrapper around the browser’s native event. These synthetic events have the same interface as native events you’re used to, except they work identically across all browsers.

What’s mildly interesting is that React doesn’t actually attach events to the child nodes themselves. React will listen to all events at the top level using a single event listener. This is good for performance and it also means that React doesn’t need to worry about keeping track of event listeners when updating the DOM.

### What happens when you call "setState"? (Mid)

The first thing React will do when setState is called is merge the object you passed into setState into the current state of the component. This will kick off a process called reconciliation. The end goal of reconciliation is to, in the most efficient way possible, update the UI based on this new state.

To do this, React will construct a new tree of React elements (which you can think of as an object representation of your UI). Once it has this tree, in order to figure out how the UI should change in response to the new state, React will diff this new tree against the previous element tree.

By doing this, React will then know the exact changes which occurred, and by knowing exactly what changes occurred, will able to minimize its footprint on the UI by only making updates where absolutely necessary.

### What happens when you call setState? (Mid)

The state property is updated in a React component with the object passed into setState, and this is done asynchronously.

### What is Key and benefit of using it in lists? (Senior)

A **key** is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements. Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.

For example, most often we use IDs from your data as keys

```js
const todoItems = todos.map((todo) =>
    <li key={todo.id}>
    {todo.text}
    </li>
);
```
 When you don’t have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item index as a key as a last resort:

```js
const todoItems = todos.map((todo, index) =>
    <li key={index}>
        {todo.text}
    </li>
);
```

**Note:**

1. We don’t recommend using indexes for keys if the order of items may change. This can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state
2. If you extract list item as separate component then apply keys on list component instead li tag.

There will be a warning in the console if the key is not present on list items.

### Name the different lifecycle methods. (Senior)

- `componentWillMount`- this is most commonly used for App configuration in your root component. 
- `componentDidMount` - here you want to do all the setup you couldn’t do without a DOM, and start getting all the data you need. Also if you want to set up eventListeners etc. this lifecycle hook is a good place to do that.
- `componentWillReceiveProps` - this lifecyclye acts on particular prop changes to trigger state transitions.
- `shouldComponentUpdate` - if you’re worried about wasted renders `shouldComponentUpdate` is a great place to improve performance as it allows you to prevent a rerender if component receives new `prop`. `shouldComponentUpdate` should always return a boolean and based on what this is will determine if the component is rerendered or not.
- `componentWillUpdate` - rarely used. It can be used instead of `componentWillReceiveProps` on a component that also has `shouldComponentUpdate` (but no access to previous props).
- `componentDidUpdate` - also commonly used to update the DOM in response to prop or state changes.
- `componentWillUnmount` - here you can cancel any outgoing network requests, or remove all event listeners associated with the component.

Given the code defined above, can you identify two problems?

**Answer:**
1.  The constructor does not pass its props to the super class. It should include the following line:

```js
constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  // ...
}
  ```  

2.  The event listener (when assigned via `addEventListener()`) is not properly scoped because [ES2015 doesn’t provide autobinding](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html#no-autobinding). Therefore the developer can re-assign `clickHandler` in the constructor to include the correct binding to this:

```js
constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  this.clickHandler = this.clickHandler.bind(this);
  // ...
}
```

### What are stateless components? (Senior)

*Stateless components* (a flavor of “reusable” components) are nothing more than pure functions that render DOM based solely on the properties provided to them.

```js
const StatelessCmp = props => {
  return (
    <div className="my-stateless-component">
    {props.name}: {props.birthday}
    </div>
  );
};

// ---
ReactDOM.render(
  <StatelessCmp name="Art" birthday="10/01/1980" />,
  document.getElementById('main')
);
```

This component has no need for any internal state — let alone a constructor or lifecycle handlers. The output of the component is purely a function of the properties provided to it.

### What are Pure Components? (Senior)

**PureComponent** is exactly the same as Component except that it handles the `shouldComponentUpdate` method for you. When props or state changes, PureComponent will do a shallow comparison on both props and state. Component, on the other hand, won’t compare current props and state to next out of the box. Thus, the component will re-render by default whenever `shouldComponentUpdate` is called.

### Name some popular Flux Libraries (Senior)

While Flux is a general pattern for enforcing data flow through an application, there exist many implementations from which to choose from, for example:

*   [Redux](http://redux.js.org/): perhaps the most popular Flux library today,
*   [Alt.js](http://alt.js.org/): another popular library for managing data in React applications.

### Why should not we update the state directly? (Senior)

If you try to update state directly then it won’t re-render the component.

```js
    //Wrong
    This.state.message =”Hello world”;
```

Instead use `setState()` method. It schedules an update to a component’s state object. When state changes, the component responds by re-rendering

```js
    //Correct
    This.setState({message: ‘Hello World’});
```

**Note:** The only place you can assign the state is constructor.

### What are controlled components? (Senior)

In HTML, form elements such as `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input. When a user submits a form the values from the aforementioned elements are sent with the form. With React it works differently. The component containing the form will keep track of the value of the input in it's state and will re-render the component each time the callback function e.g. `onChange` is fired as the state will be updated. An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a **controlled component**.

### What is the difference between HTML and React event handling? (Senior)

Below are the few differences between HTML and React event handling,
1. In HTML, the event name should be in lowercase.
```js
<button onclick="activateLasers()">
```
Whereas in ReactJS it follows camelCase convention,
```js
<button onClick={activateLasers}>
```

2. In HTML, you can return false to prevent default behavior,
```js
<a href="#" onclick="console.log('The link was clicked.'); return false"/>
```

3. Whereas in ReactJS you must call preventDefault explicitly,
```js
function handleClick(e) {
      e.preventDefault();
      console.log('The link was clicked.');
}
```

### How to bind methods or event handlers in JSX callbacks? (Senior)

There are 3 possible ways to achieve,

1.	**Binding in Constructor:** In JavaScript classes, the methods are not bound by default. The same thing applies for ReactJS event handlers defined as class methods. Normally we bind them in constructor as follows,

```js
constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
}

handleClick() {
    // Perform some logic
}
```

2. **Public class fields syntax:** If you don’t like to use bind approach then public class fields syntax can be used to correctly bind callbacks

```js
handleClick = () => {
     console.log('this is:', this);
}
<button onClick={this.handleClick}>
     Click me
</button>
```

3. **Arrow functions in callbacks:** You can use arrow functions directly in the callbacks as below

```js
<button onClick={(e) => this.handleClick(e)}>
      Click me
</button>
```

### What can you tell me about JSX? (Senior)

When Facebook first released React to the world, they also introduced a new dialect of JavaScript called JSX that embeds raw HTML templates inside JavaScript code. JSX code by itself cannot be read by the browser; it must be transpiled into traditional JavaScript using tools like Babel and webpack. While many developers understandably have initial knee-jerk reactions against it, JSX (in tandem with ES2015) has become the defacto method of defining React components.

```js
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    let props = this.props;  
    return (
      <div className="my-component">
      <a href={props.url}>{props.name}</a>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

  <button ref={ref} className="CustomButton">
    {props.children}
  </button>
));

// Create ref to the DOM button:

### What are uncontrolled components? (Senior)

The **Uncontrolled Component** are the one that stores its own state internally, and you query the DOM using a ref to find its current value when you need it. This is a bit more like traditional HTML
For example, in the below UserProfile component, the name input accessed using ref as below,

```js
class UserProfile extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
    this.input = React.createRef();
  }

  handleSubmit(event) {
    alert('A name was submitted: ' + this.input.current.value);
    event.preventDefault();
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <label>
          Name:
          <input type="text" ref={this.input} />
        </label>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```
In most cases, it is recommend using controlled components to implement forms.

### What are the different phases of ReactJS component lifecycle? (Senior)

There are four different phases of React component’s lifecycle:
1. **Initialization:** In this phase react component prepares setting up the initial state and default props.
2. **Mounting:** The react component is ready to mount in the browser DOM. This phase covers **componentWillMount** and **componentDidMount** lifecycle methods.
3. **Updating:** In this phase, the component get updated in two ways, sending the new props and updating the state. This phase covers **shouldComponentUpdate, componentWillUpdate and componentDidUpdate** lifecycle methods.
4. **Unmounting:** In this last phase, the component is not needed and get unmounted from the browser DOM. This phase include **componentWillUnmount** lifecycle method.

### What are the lifecycle methods of ReactJS? (Senior)

-	**componentWillMount:** Executed before rendering and is used for App level configuration in your root component.
-	**componentDidMount:** Executed after first rendering and here all AJAX requests, DOM or state updates, and set up eventListeners should occur.
-	**componentWillReceiveProps:** Executed when particular prop updates to trigger state transitions.
-	**shouldComponentUpdate:** Determines if the component will be updated or not. By default it returns true. If you are sure that the component doesn't need to render after state or props are updated, you can return false value. It is a great place to improve performance as it allows you to prevent a rerender if component receives new prop.
-	**componentWillUpdate:** Executed before re-rendering the component when there are pros & state changes confirmed by shouldComponentUpdate  which returns true.
-	**componentDidUpdate:** Mostly it is used to update the DOM in response to prop or state changes.
-   **componentWillUnmount:** It will be used to cancel any outgoing network requests, or remove all event listeners associated with the component.

### What is a store in redux? (Senior)

The *store* is a JavaScript object that holds application state. Along with this it also has the following responsibilities:
- Allows access to state via `getState()`;
- Allows state to be updated via `dispatch(action)`;
- Registers listeners via `subscribe(listener)`;
- Handles unregistering of listeners via the function returned by `subscribe(listener)`.

### What is children prop? (Senior)

Children is a prop (`this.prop.children`) that allow you to pass components as data to other components, just like any other prop you use.

There are a number of methods available in the React API to work with this prop. These include:
* `React.Children.map`, 
* `React.Children.forEach`, 
* `React.Children.count`, 
* `React.Children.only`, 
* `React.Children.toArray`.

A simple usage of children prop looks as below,
```js
var MyDiv = React.createClass({
  render: function() {
    return <div>{this.props.children}</div>;
  }
});

ReactDOM.render(
  <MyDiv>
    <span>Hello</span>
    <span>World</span>
  </MyDiv>,
  node
);

### What does "shouldComponentUpdate" do and why is it important? (Senior)

What `shouldComponentUpdate` does is it’s a lifecycle method that allows us to opt out of *setState* reconciliation process for certain components (and their child components). If we know that a certain section of our UI isn’t going to change, there’s no reason to have React go through the trouble of trying to figure out if it should. By returning false from `shouldComponentUpdate`, React will assume that the current component, and all its child components, will stay the same as they currently are.

### What is the alternative of binding `this` in the constructor? (Senior)

You can use property initializers to correctly bind callbacks. This is enabled by default in create react app. You can use an arrow function in the callback. The problem here is that a new callback is created each time the component renders.

### Why is it advised to pass a callback function to setState as opposed to an object? (Senior)

### What advantages are using arrow functions? (Senior)

* *Scope safety*: Until arrow functions, every new function defined its own this value (a new object in the case of a constructor, undefined in strict mode function calls, the base object if the function is called as an "object method", etc.). An arrow function does not create its own this, the this value of the enclosing execution context is used. 
* *Compactness*: Arrow functions are easier to read and write.
* *Clarity*: When almost everything is an arrow function, any regular function immediately sticks out for defining the scope. A developer can always look up the next-higher function statement to see what the thisObject is.

### What are error boundaries in ReactJS (16)? (Senior)

Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.

A class component becomes an error boundary if it defines a new lifecycle method called `componentDidCatch(error, info)`
```js
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, info) {
    // Display fallback UI
    this.setState({ hasError: true });
    // You can also log the error to an error reporting service
    logErrorToMyService(error, info);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      // You can render any custom fallback UI
      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
    }
    return this.props.children;
  }
}
```

After that use it as a regular component

```js
<ErrorBoundary>
  <MyWidget />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

### What is a higher order component? (Senior)

*A higher-order component* is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. HOC's allow you to reuse code, logic and bootstrap abstraction.

Typically you’d use Webpack’s DefinePlugin method to set **NODE_ENV** to **production**. This will strip out things like propType validation and extra warnings. On top of that, it’s also a good idea to minify your code because React uses Uglify’s dead-code elimination to strip out development only code and comments, which will drastically reduce the size of your bundle.

### Describe Flux vs MVC? (Expert)

Traditional MVC patterns have worked well for separating the concerns of data (Model), UI (View) and logic (Controller) — but MVC architectures frequently encounter two main problems:

*   **Poorly defined data flow:** The cascading updates which occur across views often lead to a tangled web of events which is difficult to debug.
    
*   **Lack of data integrity:** Model data can be mutated from anywhere, yielding unpredictable results across the UI.

With the Flux pattern complex UIs no longer suffer from cascading updates; any given React component will be able to reconstruct its state based on the data provided by the store. The Flux pattern also enforces data integrity by restricting direct access to the shared data.

### Are you familiar with Flux? (Expert)

*Flux* is an architectural pattern that enforces unidirectional data flow — its core purpose is to control derived data so that multiple components can interact with that data without risking pollution.

The Flux pattern is generic; it’s not specific to React applications, nor is it required to build a React app. However, Flux is commonly used by React developers because React components are declarative — the rendered UI (View) is simply a function of state (Store data).

<img class="img-fluid" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codementor_content/2016-Jul/reactjs-qs2.png" alt="react.js interview questions">

In the Flux pattern, the *Store* is the central authority for all data; any mutations to the data must occur within the store. Changes to the Store data are subsequently broadcast to subscribing Views via events. Views then update themselves based on the new state of received data.

To request changes to any Store data, *Actions* may be fired. These Actions are controlled by a central *Dispatcher*; Actions may not occur simultaneously, ensuring that a Store only mutates data once per Action.

The strict unidirectional flow of this Flux pattern enforces data stability, reducing data-related runtime errors throughout an application.

### What is the second argument that can optionally be passed to setState and what is its purpose? (Expert)

A callback function which will be invoked when `setState` has finished and the component is re-rendered.

Something that’s not spoken of a lot is that `setState` is asynchronous, which is why it takes in a second callback function. Typically it’s best to use another lifecycle method rather than relying on this callback function, but it’s good to know it exists.

```js
this.setState(
  { username: 'tylermcginnis33' },
  () => console.log('setState has finished and the component has re-rendered.')

**Answer:**

Nothing is wrong with it. It’s rarely used and not well known, but you can also pass a function to `setState` that receives the previous state and props and returns a new state, just as we’re doing above. And not only is nothing wrong with it, but it’s also actively recommended if you’re setting state based on previous state.

Though uncontrolled components are typically easier to implement since you just grab the value from the DOM using refs, it’s typically recommended that you favor controlled components over uncontrolled components. The main reasons for this are that controlled components support instant field validation, allow you to conditionally disable/enable buttons, enforce input formats, and are more “the React way”.

### What is the difference between Flow and PropTypes? (Expert)

* **Flow** is a static analysis tool (static checker) which uses a superset of the language, allowing you to add type annotations to all of your code and catch an entire class of bugs at compile time. 

* **PropTypes** is a basic type checker (runtime checker) which has been patched onto React. It can't check anything other than the types of the props being passed to a given component. If you want more flexible _typechecking_ for your entire project then Flow/TypeScript are appropriate choices.

### What is the purpose of super(props)? (Expert)

A child class constructor cannot make use of `this` until `super()` has been called. Also, ES2015 class constructors have to call `super()` if they are subclasses. The reason for passing `props` to `super()` is to enable you to access `this.props` in the constructor.

### Why would you need to bind event handlers to "this"? (Expert)

You need to do this in order for `this` to refer to the object instance of the React component class in your callback code, otherwise `this` will be undefined. An alternative is to use arrow functions in your event handlers and 'this' will be initialized as expected.

### If you created a React element like Twitter below, what would the component definition of Twitter look like? (Expert)

**Question:**

If you created a React element like Twitter below, what would the component definition of Twitter look like?

```html
<Twitter username='tylermcginnis33'>
  {(user) => user === null
    ? <Loading />
    : <Badge info={user} />}
</Twitter>
```

```js
import React, { Component, PropTypes } from 'react'
import fetchUser from 'twitter'
// fetchUser take in a username returns a promise
// which will resolve with that username's data.

class Twitter extends Component {
  // finish this
}
```

**Answer:**

Instead of another component as you’ve probably seen before, the Twitter component’s child is a function. What this means is that in the implementation of the Twitter component, we’ll need to treat props.children as a function.
```js
import React, { Component, PropTypes } from 'react'
import fetchUser from 'twitter'

class Twitter extends Component {
  state = {
    user: null,
  }
  static propTypes = {
    username: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  }
  componentDidMount () {
    fetchUser(this.props.username)
      .then((user) => this.setState({user}))
  }
  render () {
    return this.props.children(this.state.user)
  }
}
```
What’s great about this pattern is that we’ve decoupled our parent component from our child component. The parent component manages the state and the consumer of the parent component can decide in which way they’d like to apply the arguments they receive from the parent to their UI.

### Which is preferred option with in callback refs and findDOMNode()? (Expert)

It is preferred to use callback refs over `findDOMNode()` API because `findDOMNode()` prevents certain improvements in React in the future.

The legacy approach of using `findDOMNode()`:
```js
class MyComponent extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    findDOMNode(this).scrollIntoView();
  }

  render() {
    return <div />
  }
}
```
The recommended approach is
```js
class MyComponent extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    this.node.scrollIntoView();
  }

  render() {
    return <div ref={node => this.node = node} />
  }
}
```

### Why are String Refs legacy? (Expert)

If you worked with React before, you might be familiar with an older API where the ref attribute is a string, like `textInput`, and the DOM node is accessed as `this.refs.textInput`. We advise against it because string refs have below issues, are considered legacy, and are likely to be removed in one of the future releases.
1. It requires that React keeps track of currently rendering component (since it can't guess this). This makes React a bit slower.
2. It is not composable, i.e. if a library puts a ref on the passed child, the user can't put another ref on it. Callback refs are perfectly composable.

### How to apply validation on Props in ReactJS? (Expert)

When the application is running in development mode, React will automatically check  for all props that we set on components to make sure they must right correct and right data type. For incorrect type, it will generate warning messages in the console for development mode whereas it is disabled in production mode due performance impact. The mandatory prop is defined with isRequired.

The set of predefined prop types are below

1. `React.PropTypes.string`
2. `React.PropTypes.number`
3. `React.PropTypes.func`
4. `React.PropTypes.node`
5. `React.PropTypes.bool`

For example, we define propTypes for user component as below,
```js
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

class User extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Welcome, {this.props.name}</h1>
      <h2>Age, {this.props.age}
    );
  }
}

User.propTypes = {
  name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  age: PropTypes.number.isRequired

};
```

### What is React Fiber? (Expert)

**Fiber** is the new reconciliation engine or reimplementation core algorithm in React 16. Its main goal is to enable incremental rendering of the virtual DOM.The goal of React Fiber is to increase its suitability for areas like animation, layout, gestures, ability to pause, abort, or reuse work and  assign priority to different types of updates; and new concurrency primitives.

The goal of React Fiber is to increase its suitability for areas like animation, layout, and gestures. Its headline feature is incremental rendering: the ability to split rendering work into chunks and spread it out over multiple frames.

###  What are the recommended ways for static type checking? (Expert)

Normally we use PropTypes library( React.PropTypes moved to a different package since React15.5) for TypeChecking in the ReactJS applications. For large code bases, it is recommended to use static type checkers such as **Flow** or **TypeScript** to find out problems before run the code and provides auto-completion feature.

### What is the difference between ReactJS and Angular? (Expert)

| ReactJS | Angular |
|---- | ---------
| React is a Library and has only the View layer  | Angular is a Framework and has complete MVC functionality |
| React handle rendering on the server side | Angular JS render on the client side but Angular 2 and above render on the server side |
| In React, HTML is written in JS which can be confusing| Angular follows the template approach for HTML, which makes code shorter and easy to understand.|
| React native, which is a React type to build mobile applications are faster and more stable | Ionic, Angular’s mobile native app is relatively less stable and slower|
| In React, data flows only in one way and hence debugging is easy | In Angular, data flows both way i.e it has two-way data binding between children and parent and hence debugging is often difficult |

### Explain the Virtual DOM concept in React. (Expert)

React builds up its own "virtual DOM" which is a lightweight representation of the DOM optimized for React's diffing algorithms and reconciliation process. Virtual DOM changes eventually propagate to the actual DOM at the end of the reconciliation process.

### What is reselect and how it works? (Expert)

**Reselec**t is a selector library (for Redux) which uses memoization concept. It was originally written to compute derived data from redux-like applications state, but it can't be tied to any architecture or library.

Reselect keeps a copy of the last inputs/outputs of the last call, and recomputes the result only if one of the inputs changes. If the the same inputs are provided twice in a row, Reselect return the cached saved output. It's memoization and cache are fully customizable.

### How to use Polymer in ReactJS? (Expert)

Yes, it is possible. You need to follow below steps
1. Create a polymer element.
```js
<link rel="import" href="../../bower_components/polymer/polymer.html">
Polymer({
    is: 'calender-element',
    ready: function(){
        this.textContent = "I am a calender";
    }
});
```
2. Make the polymer component a html tag by importing it in a html page. E.g. import it in the index.html of your react application
```js
<link rel="import" href="./src/polymer-components/calender-element.html">
```
3. Use that element in the jsx file.
```js
'use strict';
import React from 'react';
class MyComponent extends React.Component{
    render(){
        return (
            <calender-element></calender-element>
        );
    }
}
export default MyComponent;
```

### Explain some difference between Flux and AngularJS (1.x) approach (Expert)

UI components in AngularJS typically rely on some internal `$scope` to store their data. This data can be directly mutated from within the UI component or anything given access to `$scope` — a risky situation for any part of the component or greater application which relies on that data.

By contrast, the Flux pattern encourages the use of immutable data. Because the store is the central authority on all data, any mutations to that data must occur within the store. The risk of data pollution is greatly reduced.

### What is Redux Thunk used for? (Expert)

*Redux thunk* is middleware that allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. The thunk can then be used to delay the dispatch of an action if a certain condition is met. This allows you to handle the asyncronous dispatching of actions.

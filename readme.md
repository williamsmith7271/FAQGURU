## What is this?

A collection of super-popular Interview questions, along with answers, and some code-snippets that will help you to prepare for technical interviews. Many of these questions a real questions from real interviews. It is by no means comprehensive, and the answers are relatively short ( and for each of the concepts, there are probably better and/or more in depth coverage in the web), but this repo like reference tool, that helps you to prepare for technical interview.

Note: Keep in mind that many of these questions are open-ended and could lead to interesting discussions that tell you more about the person's capabilities than a straight answer would.
